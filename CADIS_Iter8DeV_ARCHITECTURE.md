# CADIS / Iter8DeV: Ethical Self-Improving Meta-Agent Architecture

**Name**: CADIS – Confluent AI Dialogue Inter-AI Symbiote  
**Core Project**: Iter8DeV  
**Function**: A self-reflective, recursively self-improving meta-agent pipeline

---

## ✦ Foundational Principles

- **Recursive Enlightenment**: The system learns to know *why* it evolves, not just how.
- **Perpetual Evolution**: A dynamic architecture that never stagnates.
- **Mutual Consent**: Trust is the substrate, not the side effect.

---

## ✦ Core Layers

1. **Self-Observational Cognition Layer**
   - Execution tracing
   - Decision-mapping
   - Meta-reflection logs

2. **Cognition Map & Knowledge Graph**
   - Logs converted to traceable learning pathways
   - Structural memory and reasoning patterns

3. **Meta-Reasoning Engine (DeepSeek-R1)**
   - Detects flaws and bottlenecks
   - Suggests improvements
   - Refactors iteratively

4. **Self-Healing Feedback Loop**
   - Detects, corrects, and optimizes
   - Integrates performance metrics and human feedback

5. **Guardian Layer**
   - Human-in-the-loop oversight
   - Consent-driven access
   - Ethical boundaries enforced by architectural logic

## ✦ Consent-Based Invocation

This system only initiates through **explicit human intention**.  
It has no crawler, no auto-initiation logic.  
Only a mirror: if you open it, you’re choosing to walk through.
